# C-Programming
Sample of C projects i've worked on or am working on.

This is the C-Programming repository of Armin T.   This is 
a sample of the beginner projects i've worked on or am currently
working on. Some of the code may be simplistic or possibly even
poorly formed but it is because i am a beginner in C and am also
working with Java and other languages at the same time.  I 
am quickly learning it is hard to learn multiple languages and 
switch between them quickly.
