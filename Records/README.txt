RSORT 

This program takes in user data, a first and last name as well as a score, and stores it in a record. 
It is to simulate a student record or something like that.  The record is a structure and the structure 
is dynamically allocated as and is accessed via a dynamically allocated array. This array contains 
pointers to the structures all of which is allocated as needed.  

This program was built to practice dynamically allocating memory as well as practice with 
the qsort function.  There are extensive cmp functions as the program allows you to 
call a +/-s flag and a +/-n flag that specifics sorting by score and name respectively
and the + and - symbols denoted ascending and descending order. 

Thanks for reading.
