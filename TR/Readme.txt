This program was created as a simpler version of the unix tr program. It takes in two 
sets of charaters on command line and replaces characters of the first set with the characters of the 
second set - this program takes in a redirected file for character replacement. 

It's a simple program and simply does not that have to power and variety of 
the tr program. But it is a simple practice program. 

Thanks for reading.
